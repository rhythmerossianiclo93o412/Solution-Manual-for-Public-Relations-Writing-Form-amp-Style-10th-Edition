This text guides you through a logical progression of PR writing, starting with an explanation of how this kind of writing is unique and by exploring the legal and ethical obligations. It also introduces you to the different styles and techniques behind writing principles that you'll need to develop. The 10th edition features a "Writing for Select Publics" section that covers public relations writing assignments that you'll likely come across early in your career: emails, memos, letters, reports and proposals, backgrounders and position papers.
